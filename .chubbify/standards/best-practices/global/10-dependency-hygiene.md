## 9) Dependency Hygiene

- Keep third-party minimal; remove unused deps proactively.
- Auto-PRs for updates with batched weekly merges.
- Approve licenses per allowlist; deny copyleft where incompatible.
- Pin versions (lockfiles) and toolchains.

✅ Do: evaluate transitive risk.  
❌ Don’t: vendor random code without provenance.
