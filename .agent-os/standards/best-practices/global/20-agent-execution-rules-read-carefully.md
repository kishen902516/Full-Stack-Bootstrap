## 19) Agent Execution Rules (read carefully)

- **Before coding:** confirm spec goals, constraints, interfaces, and tests to add/update.  
- **While coding:** follow this doc + `tech-stack.md` + `code-style.md`; prefer explicitness; small commits.  
- **When stuck:** propose 2–3 options with trade-offs; do not guess silently.  
- **When done:** produce PR body with rationale, risk, test evidence, and migration/rollout notes.
