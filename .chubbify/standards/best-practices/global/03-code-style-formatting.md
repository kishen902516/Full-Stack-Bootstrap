## 2) Code Style & Formatting

- Follow `standards/code-style.md`. One formatter + one linter. Auto-fix on save/commit/CI.
- Keep functions small; avoid cleverness. Prefer readability over brevity.
- Naming: nouns for data types, verbs for actions. Avoid abbreviations.

✅ Do: consistent imports, file structure, and naming.  
❌ Don’t: disable linters without rationale in code comments.
