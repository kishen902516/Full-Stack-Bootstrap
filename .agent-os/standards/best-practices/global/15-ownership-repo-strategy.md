## 14) Ownership & Repo Strategy

- Clear module/service ownership, on-call rotations, escalation paths.
- Monorepo: workspaces + dep graph tooling (Nx/Gradle Composite).  
- Polyrepo: standardized skeletons, shared libs, and templates.
- Don’t fork internal libraries—compose or contribute upstream.
