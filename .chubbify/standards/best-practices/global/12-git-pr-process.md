## 11) Git & PR Process

- Trunk-based: short-lived branches; `main` always releasable.
- Small atomic PRs (≤300 LOC diff where possible); single concern per PR.
- Clear titles + bodies with “why/what/how/testing/impact” template.
- Require ≥1 non-author reviewer; CODEOWNERS enforced.

✅ Do: link tasks/specs; record decisions in ADRs.  
❌ Don’t: mix refactors and features without separate PRs.
